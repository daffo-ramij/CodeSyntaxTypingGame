https://github.com/daffo-ramij/CodeSyntaxTypingGame

make a typing game specifically designed for coding syntax, not just English words.
How it works: Instead of typing "The quick brown fox," the game makes the user type actual code snippets like for i in range(10): or System.out.println();. It calculates WPM (Words Per Minute) and Accuracy.

Why it's good: It’s a game (fun to demo) but has a clear educational purpose. You can add a "High Score" board easily.

Tech Stack:

Web: HTML/JavaScript.
